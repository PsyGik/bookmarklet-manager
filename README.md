# What do bookmarklets do?

A bookmarklet is a "one-click" tool which adds functionality to the browser, such as modifying the appearance of a web page, querying a search engine with search terms provided by previously selected text, or submitting the current page to a translation or blogging service. 

# How bookmarklets are different from extensions?

* They do basic tasks on clicking.
* They are universal, i.e. they usually work on any browser, and whatever the platform, mobile or desktop.
* They are managed as any bookmarks.

# How do I install a bookmarklet?

* Drag the bookmarklet from the page to your Bookmarks Toolbar. It should appear on the toolbar. 
  
The process is very similar for most browsers; usually the only hard part is figuring out how to show your browser's Bookmarks Toolbar â€“ but once that's taken care of, you're good to go! 

# How do I use a bookmarklet?

* Navigate to the page where you want your bookmarklet to apply to. 
* Click the bookmarklet on your Bookmarks Toolbar.
